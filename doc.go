Package github.com/sttk/sabi is a small framework to separate logic parts and
data access parts for Golang applications.

The concept of this framework is separation and reintegration of necessary and
redundant parts based on the perspectives of the whole and the
parts.
The separation of logics and data accesses is the most prominent and
fundamental part of this concept.
