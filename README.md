## What is this?

Sabi is a small framework to separate logics and data accesses for Golang applications.

A program consists of procedures and data.
And to operate data, procedures includes data accesses, then the rest of procedures except data accesses are logics.
Therefore, a program consists of logics, data accesses and data.

This package is an application framework which explicitly separates procedures into logics and data accesses as layers.
By using this framework, we can remove codes for data accesses from logic parts, and write only specific codes for each data source (e.g. database, messaging services files, and so on)  in data access  parts. 
Moreover, by separating as layers, applications using this framework can change data sources easily by switching data access parts.

## Supporting Go versions

This framework supports Go 1.18 or later.

### Actual test results for each Go version:

```
% gvm-fav
Now using version go1.18.10
go version go1.18.10 darwin/amd64
ok  	github.com/sttk-go/sabi	0.834s	coverage: 99.6% of statements

Now using version go1.19.5
go version go1.19.5 darwin/amd64
ok  	github.com/sttk-go/sabi	0.836s	coverage: 99.6% of statements

Now using version go1.20
go version go1.20 darwin/amd64
ok  	github.com/sttk-go/sabi	0.843s	coverage: 99.6% of statements

Back to go1.20
Now using version go1.20
